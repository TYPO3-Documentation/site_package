TYPO3 Site Package Extension
============================

This TYPO3 Site Package Extension is the end result of the `TYPO3 Site
Package Tutorial <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/SitePackageTutorial/>`__,
written by Michael Schams and published by the TYPO3 Documentation
Team.

The tutorial describes the steps required to turn a basic design
template (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, etc.) into a fully working,
mobile-responsive website. By following the steps of the Site Package
Tutorial, the reader builds a modern extension with all relevant files
stored at a central point and changes can easily be tracked in version
control. Despite the fact that TYPO3 supports several methods of
implementing websites, this approach is a very flexible and
professional way.
